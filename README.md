# CookIt App

This is our Phase 1 final project. The assignment is to utilize multiple APIs to accomplish a task. Our users will be able to search for a recipe and invite their friends over to enjoy a homecooked meal.

## API Usage

1. Edamam Recipe Search API

   This API will allow the user to look for a meal to cook. We will include information about the dish to let the user decide whether that is their choice.

2. Google Calendar API

   This will enable users to create a calendar event on their Google account and invite their friends.

## JS Library Usage

1. jQuery

   This was used for its convenient AJAX functions.

2. Moment.js

   Used to format all time-based information in recipe instructions.

## Our Process

-  We started off with a delivery service for recipe ingredients
-  Once we determined that the delivery aspect brought too many variables to the app (too much given the time constraints), we modified our plan to join information from the Recipe Search with nutrition facts from the USDA.
-  Upon realizing that Edamam's recipe database contains all the nutrition facts we wanted, we decided to turn the app into an "invite your guests to a homecooked meal". Google Calendars will serve as our second API.
