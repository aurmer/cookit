## API Usage

1. Edamam Recipe Search API

   This API will allow the user to look for a meal to cook. We will include information about the dish to let the user decide whether that is their choice.

2. USDA NDB API

   This API provides the user with more detailed nutritional information about the ingredients for their recipe.

## JS Library Usage

1. jQuery

   This was used for its convenient AJAX functions.

2. Moment.js

   Used to format all time-based information in recipe instructions.

## Our Process

-  We started off with a delivery service for recipe ingredients
-  Once we determined that the delivery aspect brought too many variables to the app (too much given the time constraints), we modified our plan to join information from the Recipe Search with nutrition facts from the USDA.
