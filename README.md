## API Usage

1. Edamam Recipe Search API

   This API will allow the user to look for a meal to cook. We will include information about the dish to let the user decide whether that is their choice.

2. Postmates API

   This API allows the user to order a delivery of the ingredients for the chosen recipe.

## JS Library Usage

1. jQuery

   This was used for its convenient AJAX functions.

2. Moment.js

   Used to format all time-based information in recipe instructions.
